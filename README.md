# Excercises

Here are a sample of side programs I do for fun. Some are problems from leetcode which got accepted.

* For the first program called "Pali.Java" Came from: [Palidrome Numbers](https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-number/)
I attempted to see if the number the user enters is a palidrome. The algorithm is as follows:


Get the user's input

store that input into temporary variable "keys" Then pass it into a function called isPalindrome

In a while loop:

Reverse the number

Compare the temporary number with reversed number

End, Then check and see

If both numbers are same, sysout " it's a palindrome"

Else print "nah"


* The second file is called combinetables.sql

The answer to this question came from leetcode's question on combinine two tables:
[Combine two tables](https://leetcode.com/problems/combine-two-tables/)

* The third file came from [Customers Who Never Order](https://leetcode.com/problems/customers-who-never-order/#/description)

* The fourth came from [Not Boring Movies](https://leetcode.com/problems/not-boring-movies/#/description)
